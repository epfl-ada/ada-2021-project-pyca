# Project Repository for PYCA

## Pipeline
1. Create movie data set. For each movie:
   - title
   - release date
   - boxoffice
   - press ratings
   - people ratings
   - genre
2. Relate the two data sets: quotes and movies.
   - by speaker name (directors, actors)
   - by movie title mentions (hard and less accurate)
   - by director/actor name mentions (hard and less accurate)
   - other solutions
3. Analyse the merge data to answer the following questions
   - How does press activity influences boxoffice, ratings etc
     - counts of quotes as time series, for e.g. one month before/after release
     - deeper quote analysis (PCA, sentiment analysis)
   - COME UP WITH MORE PRECISE QUESTIONS, I THINK WE CAN COME UP WITH BUNCH OF THEM
