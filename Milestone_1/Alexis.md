## Proposition

### Idea 1
Analyze the US' box office with Quotebank. We propose first to collect meaningful data about recently released movies: box office (as a time series if possible), press and user ratings, release date, list of main actors. Such data is easily accessible on the web. Next we would extract quantitative (e.g. count) and qualitative (e.g. sentiment analysis) information from the Quotebank for each movie. We could for instance use google online apis or embedded quotations into euclidian spaces and perform PCA. We are specially interested to compare what has been said on the movie before and after it was released and see how it correlates to the box office and ratings for instance. Does high media activity about a movie guarantee a success? This study could also be carried out with series from various famous web platforms (Netflix, Amazon prime, Disney).

### Idea 2
Analyze the evolution of covid related declarations in time for various categories of speakers (politics, health experts...). Covid has triggered many uncertainties in the year 2020 making some speakers radically changed their speech over time. We are interested to quantify how speech has evolved over time depending on the role of the speaker and, if any, its political family. This would require first to select speakers from various categories, analyze their quotes (e.g. with some NLP frameworks to infer some qualitative information or PCA performed on the words embeddings) and see how they have changed over time. This study would be confronted to other Covid related data, such as daily cases and daily deaths. Note: this study will be focused on early Covid times as the Quotebank stops in April 2020. We would like to see for instance if politics have more changed their mind than health experts.

### Idea 3
Analyze Donald Trump's relation with other country leaders in the light of important events. First we are interested to see how Brexit has affected the relation between Donald Trump and Boris Johnson and also with other European leaders. We might think that Brexit has strengthened the bounds between the UK and the USA, let's see what Quotebank has to say. Then we would study another interesting relation: the one with Kim Jong-Un. It has been varying a lot during Trump's presidency depending on the political context.

## Feedback
### Feedback
Great
### First idea
Very creative idea, I like it! It would be interesting to see what is the outcome of that analysis
### Second idea
Interesting idea, the fact that we have data only until April 2020 (as you mentioned) might be limiting but nevertheless, maybe it would be interesting to see short term change after the "shock"
### Third idea
Interesting direction but a bit unclear. You need to think of what exactly you would analyse when you say "analyse relation between Donald Trump and Boris Johnson", will it be the sentiment when talking about each other, how often they mention each other etc.
