1.	Concrete vs. Abstract Language Inspection from Quotes 

Language concreteness refers to language that describes things or actions in a more vivid, tangible, and specific manner (Brysbaert, Warriner, and Kuperman 2014). In contrast, abstract language focuses on the intangible attributes about objects and things (Hansen and Wanke 2010). The purpose of this study is to detect the concrete (vs. abstract) language from the news quotes in each president using machine learning approach. By observing the quote of each president candidate, we might be able to understand the relationship between the language style and each president’s support rate.


2.Detection of Figurative Language Use from Quotes in President

Figurative language serves to use more subjective expression to describe one’s feeling (Fogelin, 1988). Specifically, the use of figurative language makes one’s sensory experience more vivid and feel like they are part of scene being described (Kronrod & Danziger, 2013). For instance, “the view is blowing my mind away!” is a typical example for figurative language use in sentence. This study aims to use machine learning methods to detect the use of figurative language from quotes in each president. Figurative language may enable others to have visual imagery of the described picture, and further they might easily immerse into the speaker’s feelings and perceptions. Until now, we do not have an appropriate machine learning method to detect the use of figurative language from sentence. Through automatically detection of figurative language for each president, we might estimate whether figurative language has more (vs. less) persuasive effect when comparing the use frequency of each president and their support rate.


3.Moral Language Use on News Quotes for Conservatives vs. Liberals Attitudes 

Moral language not only reflects individuals’ perceptions about the right and wrong issues and practices, but also mirrors their political attitudes (i.e., conservatives vs. liberals). Moral language dictionary (Haidt &Graham, 2007) has moral value categories in care/harm, fairness/reciprocity, ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, purity/sanctity. Detecting moral language is important for us because we might predict the vote choice by observing the ideological preferences. 


First idea: Interesting idea!
Second idea: This idea doesn't seem to have connection to the Quotebank to me
Third idea: Again, doesn't seem connected to Quotebank, not explained well what the project would look like
